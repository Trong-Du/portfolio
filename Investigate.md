Investigative Report: Updated useAsyncGqlWithRefresh with Status Code Check Approach

1. Introduction

This report explores the implementation of an enhanced approach for handling GraphQL requests using the useAsyncGql composable in a Nuxt 3 application. The focus is on centralizing error handling, particularly for 401 Unauthorized errors, and implementing an automatic token refresh and retry mechanism. The aim is to ensure robust and maintainable code without modifying individual API calls.

2. Background

In Nuxt 3 applications using nuxt-graphql-client, the useAsyncGql composable is commonly used to execute GraphQL queries. However, handling authentication errors, specifically expired tokens (401 status codes), requires a centralized approach to avoid repetitive code and ensure seamless user experience. The useGqlError composable provides limited information, which led to the development of a custom solution.

3. Problem Statement

The key challenges identified are:
	1.	Limited Error Information: useGqlError only provides the operationName and does not include the query or variables, making it difficult to retry requests automatically after a token refresh.
	2.	Composable Context Constraints: Errors arise when composables like useNuxtApp or useAsyncGql are called outside the setup function or valid Nuxt context, limiting the ability to handle retries within global error handlers.
	3.	Code Duplication: Without centralization, handling token refresh logic in each API call leads to code redundancy and poor maintainability.

4. Proposed Solution

To address these challenges, a new composable function useAsyncGqlWithRefresh was developed. This function wraps around useAsyncGql and handles the following:
	1.	Error Detection: Checks if the GraphQL error has a status code of 401.
	2.	Token Refresh: Attempts to refresh the access token by making a request to the /api/refresh-token endpoint.
	3.	Retry Logic: Automatically retries the original GraphQL request with the new token after a successful refresh.
	4.	Redirection: Redirects the user to the login page if the token refresh fails.

5. Implementation Details

Composable: useAsyncGqlWithRefresh

// ~/composables/useAsyncGqlWithRefresh.ts
import { useAsyncGql, useNuxtApp } from '#imports'

interface GqlRequestOptions {
  query: string
  variables?: Record<string, any>
}

export async function useAsyncGqlWithRefresh<T>(options: GqlRequestOptions) {
  const nuxtApp = useNuxtApp()

  try {
    // Execute the original GraphQL request
    const { data, error } = await useAsyncGql<T>(options)
    if (error.value) throw error.value
    return { data }
  } catch (err: any) {
    const statusCode = err?.response?.status

    if (statusCode === 401) {
      console.warn('Unauthorized access detected. Attempting to refresh token.')

      try {
        // Attempt to refresh the token
        const response = await fetch('/api/refresh-token', {
          method: 'POST',
          credentials: 'include', // Include cookies for authentication
        })

        if (!response.ok) {
          throw new Error('Token refresh failed')
        }

        const { accessToken } = await response.json()
        nuxtApp.$gql.setHeader('Authorization', `Bearer ${accessToken}`)

        console.info('Token refreshed successfully. Retrying the original request.')

        // Retry the original GraphQL request
        const { data, error } = await useAsyncGql<T>(options)
        if (error.value) throw error.value
        return { data }
      } catch (refreshError) {
        console.error('Error refreshing token:', refreshError)
        nuxtApp.$router.push('/login')
        throw refreshError
      }
    } else {
      console.error('GraphQL Error:', err)
      throw err
    }
  }
}

Usage in a Component

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
import { useAsyncGqlWithRefresh } from '~/composables/useAsyncGqlWithRefresh'

interface User {
  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
}

const userData = ref<User | null>(null)

onMounted(async () => {
  const query = `
    query GetUser {
      user {
        id
        name
        email
      }
    }
  `

  try {
    const { data } = await useAsyncGqlWithRefresh<{ user: User }>({ query })
    userData.value = data?.user || null
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error fetching user data:', err)
  }
})
</script>

<template>
  <div v-if="userData">
    <p>Name: {{ userData.name }}</p>
    <p>Email: {{ userData.email }}</p>
  </div>
  <div v-else>
    <p>Loading...</p>
  </div>
</template>

6. Key Benefits
	1.	Centralized Error Handling:
	•	All GraphQL requests benefit from a single, reusable error handling and retry mechanism.
	2.	Automatic Retry:
	•	Seamless retry of the original request after a successful token refresh, reducing manual intervention.
	3.	Code Maintainability:
	•	Avoids duplication by encapsulating the token refresh logic in one place.
	4.	Graceful Failure:
	•	If the token refresh fails, users are redirected to the login page, improving user experience.

7. Limitations and Considerations
	1.	Network Latency:
	•	The retry mechanism introduces an additional network call (refresh token endpoint) before retrying the original request, which may add latency

7. Limitations and Considerations (continued)
	2.	Error Handling Granularity:
	•	The current implementation focuses on handling 401 Unauthorized errors. Additional error codes (e.g., 403 Forbidden, 500 Internal Server Error) may require different handling strategies depending on the application’s requirements.
	3.	Token Refresh Endpoint:
	•	The /api/refresh-token endpoint needs to be reliable and secure. Ensure it properly handles token expiration, validation, and returns a new access token upon success.
	4.	Concurrency Issues:
	•	If multiple API calls encounter a 401 error simultaneously, this approach may trigger multiple refresh attempts. Implementing a single-flight mechanism to consolidate refresh requests could improve efficiency.
	5.	Security Considerations:
	•	Ensure that the refreshed tokens are securely stored and handled. Avoid exposing tokens in logs or error messages.

8. Potential Improvements
	1.	Single Refresh Mechanism:
	•	Implement a mechanism to prevent multiple simultaneous refresh attempts and queue subsequent requests until the token is refreshed.
	2.	Retry Limits:
	•	Add retry limits to avoid infinite retry loops in case of persistent errors.
	3.	Detailed Logging:
	•	Enhance logging to provide more granular insights into token refresh success, failures, and retries.
	4.	Integration with Global State:
	•	Update tokens in a global store (e.g., Pinia or Vuex) to keep the token state consistent across the application.

9. Conclusion

The useAsyncGqlWithRefresh approach provides a robust, centralized solution for handling 401 Unauthorized errors in GraphQL requests within a Nuxt 3 application. By automating the token refresh and retry logic, this method improves code maintainability, reduces redundancy, and enhances the user experience by ensuring seamless request retries without manual intervention.

This solution addresses the limitations of useGqlError by encapsulating error handling within a reusable composable, ensuring scalability and adaptability for future enhancements.

10. Next Steps
	1.	Testing:
	•	Conduct comprehensive testing to handle edge cases such as network failures, expired refresh tokens, and concurrent API calls.
	2.	Documentation:
	•	Document the usage of useAsyncGqlWithRefresh for the development team to ensure consistent adoption.
	3.	Monitoring:
	•	Implement monitoring for token refresh failures to proactively identify and address issues.
	4.	Security Audit:
	•	Perform a security review of the token handling and refresh process to ensure it adheres to best practices.
